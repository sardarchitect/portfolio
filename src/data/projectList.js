      `The rights of the Native Americans have been constantly violated since the first encounter with European colonists. Today, Native reservations are exploited for their land and resources for capitalistic gains, virtually erasing their influence and footprint from this continent. Indigenous people living on reservations are disproportionately experiencing problems of poverty, connectivity, housing, education, and overall self-determination.`,

MRGPI works closely with lawyers, architects, and politicians to prioritize infrastructure development through budgetary allocations, and collective transformations. Simultaneously, the Initiative implements economically and environmentally sustainable spatial productions that all help create an inter-tribal economy.

As long as one is willing to cultivate their produce, and there are people willing to purchase, a strong and healthy relationship can be fostered. This effect is bolstered by the proximity to the Eastern Market, and two other grocery stores in the area. If business appears to be bustling at one of the places and not the other, renters will have the opportunity to connect with these groups and sell their produce at these locations. The greenhouse in particular is designed without barriers between each unit.
